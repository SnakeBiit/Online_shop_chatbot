This is my personal project, is an application CRUD(create,read,update,delete) which contains an chatbot for client budget recommandations.<br/>
The important parts of this project are:<br/>
-UI(HTML,CSS,JAVASCRIPT,BOOTSTRAP for admin page)<br/>
-BACKEND(PHP,MySql and JavaScript for the cart, i used localhost for storing the data and for displaying it in the cart)<br/>
-chatbot(PHP,JAVASCRIPT- i used botUI(a javascript framework) for the bot's UI and PHP for the bot's backend)<br/>
